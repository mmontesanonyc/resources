# Data Visualization & Communication Resources
In my work in *data communication*, I find the following resources helpful. Feel free to share widely or suggest additions based on what I have. Suggestions are welcome. 

## Writing
- [Plain Language Guidelines](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/). This is a helpful and hierarchical list of guidelines that really helps move beyond "I know it when I see it" and systematize plain language writing. Notably on this site, [Scientists need plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/resources/articles/scientists-need-plain-language/), a great overview of why plain language benefits communication products among the highly-educated. And, [Use Simple Phrases](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/use-simple-words-phrases/) is a great list of problem words.
- [America's Health Literacy](https://www.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/health-literacy/dhhs-2008-issue-brief.pdf). Research and data from HHS.
- [George Orwell's 6 rules for writing](https://www.mhpbooks.com/6-writing-rules-from-george-orwell/), from [Politics and the English Language](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/). In particular, ```Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous``` is a helpful reminder that consistency should be a tool not a prison. 
- [Race to Justice Language Guide](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/dpho/race-to-justice-action-kit-language-use-guide.pdf).
- [Evelina Judeikyte's The Plot newsletter](https://plotting.substack.com/) is one of the better sets of writing about data storytelling that I've found.

## Visualization Tools
There are a lot of visualization platforms but these are the ones I use most often. 
- [Datawrapper](www.datawrapper.de) makes making interactive, well-designed visualizations fast and easy. [Their blog](https://blog.datawrapper.de/) details new features and techniques, and [their documentation](https://academy.datawrapper.de/) is thorough.
- [Vega and Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/) allow highly customizeable visualizations through json spec. [Their online editor](https://vega.github.io/editor/) and examples are a good place to start. [Helpful tutorial](http://vda-lab.github.io/2019/12/vegalite).
- [Introducing Arquero](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/introducing-arquero). Arquero is a JS library for importing data into the browser as tables and manipulating it. Helpful for client-side data processing and manipulation, to prep data for visualization. [More](https://github.com/uwdata/arquero).

## Visualization Resources
There are lots of visualization guidelines out there. I find the [Evergreen Visualization Checklist](https://stephanieevergreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EvergreenDataVizChecklist.pdf) to be the most useful. [I made an interactive version, here](https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/interactive-evergreen-checklist/).
Additionally:
- [The Science of Visual Data Communication: What Works](https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/default+domain/10.1177%2F15291006211051956-FREE/full#.YbpbbYlu2Xw.twitter): a lengthy and powerful paper touching many aspects of evidence-based, effective data viz design.
- [VisHealth](http://www.vizhealth.org/): "a scientifically-vetted style guide for communicating health data."
- [Tufte's 6 principles](https://sites.google.com/site/tufteondesign/home/six-fundamental-principles-of-design) remain useful: show comparisons, show causality, use multivariate data, integrate evidence or other media, establish credibility, and focus on content.
- [What to consider when using text in data visualizations](https://blog.datawrapper.de/text-in-data-visualizations) from Datawrapper's blog. An excellent run-down of decisions around text (microcopy) in visualizations. 

## Critical Perspectives
- [Why Government Websites Often Struggle To Meet People's Needs](https://codeforamerica.org/news/why-government-websites-often-struggle-to-meet-peoples-needs/). A great run-down of common technical and cultural challenges within government agencies. 
- [Decolonizing Data Vis](https://stephanieevergreen.com/decolonizing-data-viz/)
- [Tweets on data vis's role in empire to military industrial complex](https://twitter.com/infowetrust/status/1436106191206182926)
- [Where Is the Rush to Visualize the Public Health Crisis of Racism?
](https://medium.com/nightingale/data-visualization-racism-a4521a1864d1)
- [How not to visualize like a racist](https://idatassist.com/how-not-to-visualize-like-a-racist/)
- [How do you visualize inequality without promoting it?](https://3iap.com/dispersion-disparity-equity-centered-data-visualization-research-project-Wi-58RCVQNSz6ypjoIoqOQ/). Interesting research on how visualization modes work with regard to racism and stereotyping.

## Health Communications
- [CDC Clear Communication Index](https://www.cdc.gov/ccindex/index.html). This is information design principles applied to designing health communication material. I often think about components of this apply to data visualization, too. [Here's my one-page app interactive version](https://mmontesanonyc.github.io/interactive-CDC-CCI/).
- - [How to Iterate on a CDC Health Advisory Graphic](https://nightingaledvs.com/how-to-iterate-on-a-cdc-health-advisory-graphic/). A strong before-and-after that brings in familiar concepts. This doesn't come from a perspective of specifically communicating health data, but the original map and styles are familiar in public health. 
- [Collaborative on Media and Messaging for Health and Social Policy](https://commhsp.org/resource-library/): a well-curated list of interdisciplinary academic research on health comms.

## Map Stuff
- [Felt](https://felt.com/) is a really cool map service. Sort of like Datawrapper but for maps - with built-in base layers, really easy interface.
- [Mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org/) lets you edit and convert shapefile, geojson, topojson, and other geo files.
- [Geojson.io](http://geojson.io/) lets you draw areas and export them as geojson.
- [json formatter](https://jsonformatter.org/) does what it says on the tin.
- [NYC Geography Files](https://github.com/nycehs/NYC_geography).

## Design
- [Datawrapper: how to pick more beautiful colors for your visualization](https://blog.datawrapper.de/beautifulcolors/). Accessible theory, practical guidance, and good resources.
- [Palleton](https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF). Interactive pallet tool
- [Coolers.co](https://coolors.co/). Color pallet generator.
- [Colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3). Classic map-focused pallet generator.
- [Color-Hex](www.color-hex.com). Useful reference.
- [Adobe Color Palette generator](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel). 
- [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/). Easy, in-browser wireframing tool. 
- Gestalt Principles: there are lots and lots of resources around the internet on these. None are as perfect as I wish they were, so [here's the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology).

## User research, usability, and related stuff
- [Civic Service Design Tools and Tactics](https://civicservicedesign.com/). A nice guide for bringing service design into government work.
- [Usability.gov](www.usability.gov). Lots of nuts-and-bolts research and guidance for usability work.

## Accessibility
- [Smashing Magazine: A Complete Guide to Accessible Front-End Components](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/complete-guide-accessible-front-end-components/)
- [Accessibility for Interactive Web Maps](https://mn.gov/mnit/assets/web-map-accessibility-guide_tcm38-403564.pdf). Part of MN.IT's fantastic [suite of documentation on accessibility and web mapping](https://mn.gov/mnit/about-mnit/accessibility/maps/web.jsp). 
- [A11y Project: Compliance Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/). Great guide.
- [Tota11y for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tota11y-for-chrome/nkghaekndgmonifcpfgjmpfjlhnmflhp?hl=en). Useful plugin. 

## Git and Github
- [Github best practices](https://github.com/tmcw/github-best-practices). I appreciate opinionated guides, even if I don't share the opinion.
- [Github Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/). A flexible, simple workflow, slightly simplified compared to [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

## Work practice and culture
- [15 rules for communicating at Github](https://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/). While I don't work in a technology-exclusive area and certainly don't follow all of these practices, I like a close, critical look at what tools you use, and when and why you use them.

## Programming and Web Development
- [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) is a well-paced set of lessons that has helped me expand my JavaScript vocabulary.
- [Codecademy: JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript). Great for learning the fundamentals.
- [Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmINlrza7JHB1zkIOuXEbw). I've used his Youtube tutorials for JS, Hugo, Jekyll, and more. They're well-paced and definitely get you moving.
- [Regis Philibert's blog](https://www.regisphilibert.com/blog/) helps shed light on how Hugo works. 
- [GridEd(itor)](https://nickstrayer.me/grided). A handy little grid code generator.
- [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc). I haven't dug deeply into this but from scanning it, the fact that it's written for the 'lay programmer' is appealing.
