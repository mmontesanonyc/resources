# Helpful Resources
Here's a list of things I often find useful. Things often get lost in bookmarks, but it feels easier to organize them here. Plus, this makes everything easier to share. 

## Writing
- [Plain Language Guidelines](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/). This is a helpful and hierarchical list of guidelines that really helps move beyond "I know it when I see it" and systematize plain language writing. Notably on this site, [Scientists need plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/resources/articles/scientists-need-plain-language/), a great overview of why plain language benefits communication products among the highly-educated. And, [Use Simple Phrases](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/use-simple-words-phrases/) is a great list of problem words.
- [America's Health Literacy](https://www.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/health-literacy/dhhs-2008-issue-brief.pdf). Research and data from HHS.
- [George Orwell's 6 rules for writing](https://www.mhpbooks.com/6-writing-rules-from-george-orwell/), from [Politics and the English Language](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/). In particular, ```Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous``` is a helpful reminder that consistency should be a tool not a prison. 
- [Race to Justice Language Guide](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/dpho/race-to-justice-action-kit-language-use-guide.pdf).

## Visualization Tools
- [Datawrapper](www.datawrapper.de) makes making interactive, well-designed visualizations fast and easy. [Their blog](https://blog.datawrapper.de/) details new features and techniques, and [their documentation](https://academy.datawrapper.de/) is thorough.
- [Vega and Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/) allow highly customizeable visualizations through json spec. [Their online editor](https://vega.github.io/editor/) and examples are a good place to start. [Helpful tutorial](http://vda-lab.github.io/2019/12/vegalite).
- [Introducing Arquero](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/introducing-arquero). Arquero is a JS library for importing data into the browser as tables and manipulating it. Helpful for client-side data processing and manipulation, to prep data for visualization. [More](https://github.com/uwdata/arquero).

## Visualization Resources
There are lots of visualization guidelines out there. I find the [Evergreen Visualization Checklist](https://stephanieevergreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EvergreenDataVizChecklist.pdf) to be the most useful. A few more helpful resources:
- [CDC Clear Communication Index](https://www.cdc.gov/ccindex/index.html). This is information design principles applied to designing health communication material. I often think about components of this apply to data visualization, too. 
- [How to Iterate on a CDC Health Advisory Graphic](https://nightingaledvs.com/how-to-iterate-on-a-cdc-health-advisory-graphic/). A strong before-and-after that brings in familiar concepts. This doesn't come from a perspective of specifically communicating health data, but the original map and styles are familiar in public health. 
- [Tufte's 6 principles](https://sites.google.com/site/tufteondesign/home/six-fundamental-principles-of-design) remain useful: show comparisons, show causality, use multivariate data, integrate evidence or other media, establish credibility, and focus on content.
- Perspectives:
  - [Decolonizing Data Vis](https://stephanieevergreen.com/decolonizing-data-viz/)
  - [Tweets on data vis's role in empire to military industrial comples](https://twitter.com/infowetrust/status/1436106191206182926)

## Map Stuff
- [Mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org/) lets you edit and convert shapefile, geojson, topojson, and other geo files.
- [Geojson.io](http://geojson.io/) lets you draw areas and export them as geojson.
- [json formatter](https://jsonformatter.org/) does what it says on the tin.
- [NYC Geography Files](https://github.com/nycehs/NYC_geography).

## Design
- [Datawrapper: how to pick more beautiful colors for your visualization](https://blog.datawrapper.de/beautifulcolors/). Accessible theory, practical guidance, and good resources.
- [Palleton](https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF). Interactive pallet tool
- [Coolers.co](https://coolors.co/). Color pallet generator.
- [Colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3). Classic map-focused pallet generator.
- [Color-Hex](www.color-hex.com). Useful reference.
- Gestalt Principles: there are lots and lots of resources around the internet on these. None are as perfect as I wish they were, so [here's the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology).

## Accessibility
- [Smashing Magazine: A Complete Guide to Accessible Front-End Components](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/complete-guide-accessible-front-end-components/)
- [Accessibility for Interactive Web Maps](https://mn.gov/mnit/assets/web-map-accessibility-guide_tcm38-403564.pdf). Part of MN.IT's fantastic [suite of documentation on accessibility and web mapping](https://mn.gov/mnit/about-mnit/accessibility/maps/web.jsp). 
- [A11y Project: Compliance Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/). Great guide.
- [Tota11y for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tota11y-for-chrome/nkghaekndgmonifcpfgjmpfjlhnmflhp?hl=en). Useful plugin. 

## Git and Github
- [Github best practices](https://github.com/tmcw/github-best-practices). I appreciate opinionated guides, even if I don't share the opinion.
- [Github Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/). A flexible, simple workflow, slightly simplified compared to [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

## Work practice and culture
- [15 rules for communicating at Github](https://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/). While I don't work in a technology-exclusive area and certainly don't follow all of these practices, I like a close, critical look at what tools you use, and when and why you use them.

## Web Stuff
- [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) is a well-paced set of lessons that has helped me expand my JavaScript vocabulary.
- [Codecademy: JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript). Great for learning the fundamentals.
- [Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmINlrza7JHB1zkIOuXEbw). I've used his Youtube tutorials for JS, Hugo, Jekyll, and more. They're well-paced and definitely get you moving.
- [Regis Philibert's blog](https://www.regisphilibert.com/blog/) helps shed light on how Hugo works. 
- [GridEd(itor)](https://nickstrayer.me/grided). A handy little grid code generator.
